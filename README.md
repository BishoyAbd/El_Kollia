# El Kollia
This is an android project through which Students and University Stuff can interact with each others.

This will contain:

1-easy way to connect professors with their students.

2-interactive discussions about lectures.

3-all you need to know about the college (stuff names, contacts and achievements, fabulous and dynamic timetables and even campus map).

4-notification in case of canceling or postponing any lecture.

and many wonderful features.


# NOTE

the project is feature base although it's not complete yet,but the allfearures are well decoupled ,reusable and encapsulated.it's a good example to understand the android MVP architecture.


# LATER ON
the project will be refactored to android clean architecture and I will split the modules and behaviours to many library projects
